## About

Olá! I’m Marialina Côgo Antolini, a PhD Candidate in the School of Journalism, Information and Media Program at Michigan State University. 
My research focuses on the new ways we consume and share information, focusing on how youth use social media platforms to engage in activism in the Global South and information-sharing processes in politically polarized scenarios.     
With over 20 years of professional experience, I have worked as a journalist and communication consultant for various international agencies. My work has spanned diverse areas such as security and human rights, environment, education, and mobilization, among others. 
This five-minute video shows a bit of my research: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBCNkbOSHho](Social Media Activism by Brazilian Girls)

## Research Interests
 

In my research, I’m investigating how youth in the Global South, especially young women of color from low-income communities, use social media platforms to do activism and engage in civic activities. Using a range of qualitative methods with a decolonial approach, I’m exploring topics such as storytelling processes, information consumption and sharing, community empowerment, and digital influencers as opinion leaders and political engagement online.
