I’m Marialina Antolini, a PhD Candidate in the School of Journalism, Information and Media Program at Michigan State University. 
My research investigates the new ways we consume and share information, focusing on how youth, especially young women of color from low-income communities, use social media platforms to engage in activism in the Global South and information-sharing processes in politically polarized scenarios. Using a range of qualitative methods with a decolonial approach, I’m also exploring topics such as storytelling processes, community and local voices, and digital influencers.

With over 20 years of professional experience, I have worked as a journalist and communication consultant for various international agencies. My work has spanned diverse areas such as security and human rights, environment, education, and mobilization, among others.
